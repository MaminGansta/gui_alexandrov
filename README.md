# Simple Gui library
It's a small WinApi abstraction
That support:
+ image filtering like Gaus, Box, Sharpness, Sobel (convolutions) and Median + async mod.
+ image transformations between color dimentions.
+ have some draw and async draw (shapes, lines, images).
+ alpha blending draw, ofcourse async.
+ text rendering.
+ unlimited window amount.
- all work on cpu.

Really cool library please don't use it.
